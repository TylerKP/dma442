            <p class="mainType">This is the Sansita font, a sans-serif font, by Pablo Cosgaya that I found on Google Fonts. I like the playfulness of this font as well as the sort of hand-written look, both of which are represented by the font's curliness. It is also very eye-catching. However, it is very difficult to read and should probably be used as a header rather than to provide information. According to Google Fonts, Sansita pairs well with Roboto. Here is a link to Cosgaya's <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/person/Pablo_Cosgaya/">MyFonts profile</a> page and another to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cosgaya-pablo-59852a7">LinkeIn profile</a>. According to his MyFonts profile, Cosgaya is a lecturer on Typography and Design at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. He is also on the board of directors for a post-graduate program in the same field and was also in charge of several Argentinian newspapers. </p>

            <p class="accent">This is Roboto, a sans-serif Google Fonts, by Christian Robertson. I like the rigidity of this font, the almost mechanical-perfectness of it, the geometry. This type is also pretty easy to read, which means that it is good for giving information or writing long blogs. It also makes a pretty decent header. Plus, the name is kind of cool. I believe that this is Robertson's website <a href="http://www.christianrobertson.com/">here,</a> although I am not entirely sure. According to this, he works for Google on the Android and has his own type foundry called BetaType which uses the Drupal Content Management System. This link, though, seems to be broken. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/cr64">his Twitter</a>  is full of different things, most of which is type.</p>
