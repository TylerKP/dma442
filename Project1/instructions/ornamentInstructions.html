                  <h2>Materials</h2>
                   <ul>
                      <li>Any piece of wood will do-- so long as you can fit it on the lathe.</li>
                      <li>String or rawhide or leather or yarn.</li>
                   </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Cut wood to desired size.</li>
               <li>Follow <a href="safety.html">safety</a> on correct use of tools. Create desired ornament.</li>
               <li>When finished, use the sand paper pack. Course to least course, to the point that you can switch on the lathe and rub your finger along the ornament. <strong>NOTE: Do not actually do this, as you may burn your finger.</strong></li>
               <li>If you wish to add anything, such as a wood burning of a picture or a symbol, do so now.</li>
               <li>Next, get the linseed oil and put some on either cheese cloth or a paper towel. Rub the ornament down generously.</li>
               <li>Finally, get the wax and rub the ornament down more, until you get a sheen that you like.</li>
               <li>Turn off the lathe and pull the ornament off.</li>
               <li>Drill a hole through the top of the ornament and loop the string or rawhide or leather or yarn through.</li>
