               <li>Follow instructions on the <a href="safety.html">Safety</a> page.</li>
               <li>Get pizza slicer set and pull out the pizza slicer.</li>
               <li>Scour the bottom of the pizza slicer, the little nub underneath where the head of the pizza slicer starts.</li>
               <li>You will need a large enough wood block for the handle.</li>
               <li>Cut handle to desired length.</li>
               <li>Put handle onto lathe</li>
               <li>Refer to <a href="safety.html">Safety</a> page on how to use lathe tools.</li>
               <li>Create desired shape, taking note of the head of the pizza slicer.</li>
               <li>When finished, use the sand paper pack. Course to least course, to the point that you can switch on the lathe and rub your finger along the handle. <strong>NOTE: Do not actually do this, as you may burn your finger.</strong></li>
               <li>Next, get the linseed oil and put some on either cheese cloth or a paper towel. Rub the handle down generously.</li>
               <li>Finally, get the wax and rub the handle down more, until you get a sheen that you like.</li>
               <li>Turn off the lathe and pull the handle off. Follow the instructions from the kit to put the pizza slicer on the handle.</li>
