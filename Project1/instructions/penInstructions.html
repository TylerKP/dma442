               <li>Follow instructions on the <a href="safety.html">Safety</a> page.</li>
               <li>Get pen set. Pull out the tubes.</li>
               <li>Scour the outside of the tubes.</li>
               <li>Get pen blank.</li>
               <li>Put the tubes on the pen blank; make sure there is some space between the tubes and the top and bottom of the pen blank.</li>
               <li>Mark with a pencil the top and bottom of the tubes on the pen blank.</li>
               <li>Cut the pen blank along the center most lines.</li>
               <li>Drill a hole through the center of the pen blank halves.</li>
               <li>Put wood glue in the newly cut holes, taking special care as to which one is the longer one.</li>
               <li>Put the longer pen tube into the longer pen blank, and the shorter tube in the shorter blank.</li>
               <li>Place both halves onto the lathe securely.</li>
               <li>Refer to <a href="safety.html">Safety</a> page on how to use lathe tools.</li>
               <li>When finished, use the sand paper pack. Course to least course, to the point that you can switch on the lathe and rub your finger along the pen. <strong>NOTE: Do not actually do this, as you may burn your finger.</strong></li>
               <li>Next, get the lin seedoil and put some on either cheese cloth or a paper towel. Rub the pen down generously.</li>
               <li>Finally, get the wax and rub the pen down more, until you get a sheen that you like.</li>
               <li>Turn off the lathe and pull the pen off. Using a pen press, put the pen together following the instructions in the kit.</li>
